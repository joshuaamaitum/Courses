  <glossary_data>
    <terms>
      <term title="Activity data">Data on the magnitude of a human activity resulting in emissions or removals taking place during a given period of time. Data on energy use, metal production, land areas, management systems, lime and fertilizer use and waste arisings are examples of activity data.</term>
      <term title="Adaptation">In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.</term>
      <term title="AFOLU">In the context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), AFOLU is the sum of the GHG Inventory sectors Agriculture and Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF).</term>
      <term title="Anthropogenic">Resulting from or produced by human activities. </term>
      <term title="Boreal forest ">Is a homogeneous, circumpolar vegetation belt with temperature being the most influential environmental factor determining its geographical location.</term>
      <term title="Carbon cycle">The flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g. as carbon dioxide, carbon inbiomass, and carbon dissolved in the ocean as carbonate and bicarbonate) through the atmosphere, hydrosphere, terrestrial and marine biosphere and lithosphere.</term>
      <term title="Carbon dioxide ">A naturally occurring gas, CO2 is also a by-product of burning fossil fuels (such as oil, gas and coal), of burning biomass, of land-use changes and of industrial processes (e.g. cement production). It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other GHGs are measured and therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1.</term>
      <term title="Climate change">A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/ or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.</term>
      <term title="CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) emission">The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas or a mixture of GHGs. There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO2- equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its Global Warming Potential for a 100-year time horizon. For a mix of GHGs, it is obtained by summing the CO2-equivalent emissions of each gas. CO2-equivalent emission is a common scale for comparing emissions of different GHGs, but does not imply equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses. There is generally no connection between CO2-equivalent emissions and resulting CO2-equivalent concentrations.</term>
      <term title="Conference of the Parties (COP)">The supreme body of UN conventions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, comprising parties with a right to vote that have ratified or acceded to the convention.</term>
      <term title="Country Parties">A Party is a state (or regional economic integration organization such as the European Union) that agrees to be bound by a treaty and for which the treaty has entered into force (UNFCCC definition). In this course, when we refer to country Parties, we refer to Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (or the subset of those that are Party to the Paris Agreement, depending on the context). Nearly every country is Party to the UNFCCC – all 197 UN member states are. It is important to note that for ease of reference in this course, we have referred to developing and developed countries rather than non-Annex I and Annex I respectively, although these terms are not exactly interchangeable.</term>
      <term title="Country-specific data">Data for either activities or emissions that are based on research carried out on sites, either in that country or otherwise representative of that country.</term>
      <term title="Deforestation">Conversion of forest to non-forest (IPCC, 2019; UNFCCC, glossary). </term>
      <term title="Ecosystem services">Ecological processes or functions having monetary or non-monetary value to individuals or society at large. These are frequently classified as:(1) supporting services such as productivity or biodiversity maintenance; (2) provisioning services such as food or fibre; (3) regulating services such as climate regulation or carbon sequestration; and (4) cultural services, such as tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation.</term>
      <term title="Emission factors">A coefficient that quantifies the emissions or removals of a gas per unit activity. Emission factors are often based on a sample of measurement data, averaged to develop a representative rate of emission for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions.</term>
      <term title="Forest">Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. </term>
      <term title="Forest degradation">Is when carbon stocks of forests are reduced, without forest area decreasing – for example trees are not felled, but the undergrowth and lower branches of trees are removed. FAO defines forest degradation as the long-term reduction of the overall potential supply of benefits from the forest, which includes carbon, wood, biodiversity and other goods and services. The IPCC and International Tropical Timber Organization use the following definition: a direct human-induced loss of forest values (particularly carbon), likely to be characterized by a reduction of tree crown cover. Routine management from which crown cover will recover within the normal cycle of forest management operations is not included (FAO, 2003).</term>
      <term title="Forest level">Reference levels (forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level) serve as benchmarks for assessing each country’s performance in implementing REDD+ activities. Reference levels need to maintain consistency with the country’s greenhouse gas inventory estimates (UNFCCC REDD+).</term>
      <term title="Gender equality">Women and men, girls and boys have equal conditions, treatment and  opportunities for realizing their full potential, human rights and dignity, and for contributing to (and benefiting from) economic, social, cultural and political development (FAO Term).</term>
      <term title="Greenhouse gas ">Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and ozone re the primary GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made GHGs in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the GHGs sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).</term>
      <term title="Kyoto Protocol">The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty adopted in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP3) to the UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol (mostly OECD countries and countries with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide methane), nitrous oxide, (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphurhexafluoride by at least 5 percent below 1990 levels in the first commitment period (2008–2012).</term>
      <term title="Mangroves">Mangroves are plants of more than 110 different species, including trees, shrubs, palms and ferns. They grow in the tropics and subtropics in saline intertidal coastal habitats, such as estuaries and shorelines. These species are physiologically adapted to overcome the problems of anoxia, high salinity and frequent tidal inundation (FAO, 2007).</term>
      <term title="Measurement, Reporting and Verification ">Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) 
Measurement
The process of data collection over time, providing basic data sets, including associated accuracy and precision, for the range of relevant variables. Possible data sources are field measurements, field observations, detection through remote sensing and interviews (UN REDD, 2009).
Reporting
The process of formal reporting of assessment results to the UNFCCC, according to predetermined formats and according to established standards, especially the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines and GPG (Good Practice Guidance) (UN REDD, 2009). 
Verification
The process of formal verification of reports, for example, the established approach to verify national communications and national inventory reports to the UNFCCC (UN REDD, 2009).</term>
      <term title="Mitigation">A human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.</term>
      <term title="MRV for REDD+">MRV for REDD+ is a two-step process: first, there is a technical assessment of the proposed forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level (FREL). Second, the actual results compared with the assessed FREL are submitted in a technical annex to the Biennial Update Report of a developing country Party seeking to obtain and receive payments for results-based actions, and these results undergo a separate technical analysis (UNFCCC REDD+).</term>
      <term title="National forest inventory ">A national forest inventory (NFI) is commonly used to describe the technical process of data compilation and analysis of forest resources from a multitude of data sources, including field inventories and remote sensing, to estimate relevant forest characteristics at particular points in time.</term>
      <term title="National forest monitoring ">National forest monitoring (NFM) is a comprehensive process that includes the systematic collection, analysis and dissemination of forest-related data and the derivation of information, usually from repeated inventories (of both remote-sensing and ground data) that allow forest changes and trends to be identified and quantified over time, as well as the drivers of such changes and trends.</term>
      <term title="National Forest Monitoring System">A National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) comprises the people, institutions and resources that implement national forest monitoring at country level in collaboration with other stakeholders.</term>
      <term title="National strategy or action plan">A national strategy or action plan is one of the elements to be developed by developing country Parties implementing REDD+ activities (according to paragraph 71 of decision 1/CP.16). This national strategy or action plan is highly dependent upon national circumstances (UNFCCC REDD+).</term>
      <term title="Nationally Determined Contributions ">The term Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) is used under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, whereby a country that has joined the Paris Agreement outlines its plans for reducing its emissions. Some countries’ NDCs also address how they will adapt to climate change impacts, and what support they need from, or will provide to, other countries to adopt low-carbon pathways and to build climate resilience. According to Article 4 paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement, each Party shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive NDCs that it intends to achieve. In the lead up to the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015, countries submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). As countries join the Paris Agreement, unless they decide otherwise, this INDC becomes their first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).</term>
      <term title="Paris Agreement">The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted on December 2015 in Paris, France, at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. The agreement, adopted by 196 Parties to the UNFCCC, entered into force on 4 November 2016 and as of May 2018 had 195 Signatories and was ratified by 177 Parties. One of the goals of the Paris Agreement is ‘Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Additionally, the Agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement is intended to become fully effective in 2020.</term>
      <term title="Quality assurance">Quality assurance (QA) activities include a planned system of review procedures conducted by personnel not directly involved in the inventory compilation/development process to verify that data quality objectives were met, ensure that the inventory represents the best possible estimate of emissions and sinks, given the current state of scientific knowledge and data available, and support the effectiveness of the quality control programme. </term>
      <term title="Quality control">Quality control (QC) is a system of routine technical activities, to measure and control the quality of the inventory as it is being developed. </term>
      <term title="REDD+">REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) refers to reducing emissions from deforestation; reducing emissions from forest degradation; conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (see UNFCCC decision 1/CP.16, para. 70).</term>
      <term title="Removals ">Removal of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors from the atmosphere by a sink.</term>
      <term title="Safeguards">A system for providing information on how the safeguards are being addressed and respected is one of the elements to be developed by developing country Parties implementing REDD+ activities (UNFCCC REDD+).</term>
      <term title="Sink">Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. (UNFCCC Article 1.8) Notation in the final stages of reporting is the negative (-) sign.</term>
      <term title="Source">Any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. (UNFCCC Article 1.9) Notation in the final stages of reporting is the positive (+) sign.</term>
      <term title="Tier">A tier represents a level of methodological complexity in the compilation of a greenhouse gas inventory, as classified by the IPCC. Usually three tiers are provided. Tier 1 is the basic method, Tier 2 intermediate and Tier 3 most demanding in terms of complexity and data requirements. Tiers 2 and 3 are sometimes referred to as higher-tier methods and are generally considered to be more accurate.</term>
      <term title="Time series">A time series is a series of values that are affected by random processes and which are observed at successive (usually equidistant) points in time.</term>
      <term title="Tropical forests">Tropical forests are found near the Equator in hot places where there is no dry season, receiving rain every month of the year.</term>
      <term title="Uncertainty">Lack of knowledge of the true value of a variable that can be described as a probability density function characterizing the range and likelihood of possible values. Uncertainty depends on the analyst’s state of knowledge, which in turn depends on the quality and quantity of applicable data, as well as knowledge of underlying processes and inference methods.</term>
      <term title="UNFCCC">The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in May 1992 and opened for signature at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. It entered into force in March 1994 and as of May 2018 had 195 Parties. The Convention’s ultimate objective is the ‘stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’. The provisions of the Convention are pursued and implemented by two treaties: the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.</term>
